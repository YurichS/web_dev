            Enduro in its most basic definition is a type of mountain bike racing where the downhills are timed, and the
            uphills are mandatory but not timed. Riders are timed in stages that are primarily downhill, with
            neutral "transfer" stages in between. The transfer stages usually must be completed within a time-limit, but
            are not part of the accumulated time.
